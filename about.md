Sometimes I code; check out some of my [projects](/work/)!

Some of the languages and tools I am comfortable with are:
- Python, JavaScript & node.js, Java, PHP
- HTML, CSS/Sass, JavaScript, jQuery
- Jekyll, Django, Flask, React, Express
- Git, LaTeX, SQL, Anaconda, Docker
- PowerShell for personal system scripts (+ some bash)

I'm also interested in cybersecurity, which at the moment is most quantifiable by competitions.
My tools include virtual machines (Windows and Linux), Wireshark, Python, PowerShell/Bash,
and an extensive laundry list of forensics and system utilities.

Some achievements and the like:
- **3x national finalist** &mdash; Canada CyberTitan *(defensive cybersecurity competition)*
	- 2022, 2021: 1st
	- 2020: 3rd
- **Global finalist** -- US CyberPatriot (2022: 5th)
- **2x top 10 globally** &mdash; picoCTF *(Capture-the-Flag cybersecurity competition)*
	- 2022: 1st in Canada, 3rd globally
	- 2021: 2nd in Canada, 7th globally
- **2x international finalist** &mdash; HOSA health sciences competition (2022, 2021) *(ILC)*
