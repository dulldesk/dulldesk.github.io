I greatly enjoy computer programming and scripting; writing code for some purpose is something I often do in my free time. Check out [some of my projects here](/work/)!

Some of the languages and tools I am comfortable with are:
- JavaScript (node.js), Python, and Java for general programming
- The aforementioned languages as well as C++ for competitive programming
- HTML, CSS/Sass, JavaScript (including jQuery) for web development
- the Jekyll and Django web frameworks
- Jinja templating
- PHP
- Git
- PowerShell for personal system scripts

Some other things I'm interested in:
- Instrumental music (piano and the clarinet)
- Cybersecurity
- Volunteering for various causes (e.g. graphic design, web development, tutoring)
