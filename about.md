I study Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.
I learn fast, but some of the languages and tools I'm more familiar with include:
- Python, JavaScript/Node.js, TypeScript, Java, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, Go
- Django, React, Angular, Express, Flask, Sass
- Docker, SQL, Anaconda, Jenkins, Groovy, LaTeX, Git
- PowerShell, Bash for personal system scripts

I'm also interested in cybersecurity, which at the moment is most quantifiable by competitions.
My tools include virtual machines (Windows and Linux), Wireshark, Python, PowerShell/Bash,
Docker containers,
and an extensive laundry list of forensics and system utilities.

Some achievements and the like:
