I greatly enjoy computer programming and scripting; writing code for some purpose is something I often do in my free time. Check out some of my projects [here](/work)!

The languages I am comfortable with are:
- JavaScript, Python, and Java for general programming
- The aforementioned languages as well as C++ for competitive programming
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for web development
- PowerShell for personal system scripts

Some other things I'm interested in:
- Instrumental music (piano and the clarinet)
- Cybersecurity
- Volunteering for various causes (e.g. graphic design, web development, tutoring)

Some achievements and the like:
- Canadian Computing Competition Senior Level honour roll (2020)
- National Finalist of CyberTitan III (cybersecurity competition; 3rd in Canada) (2020)
- Acceptance into SHAD Canada summer program (2020, 2021)
- Acceptance into Columbia University summer program (2020)
- Honour roll of several mathematics contests (since 2015)
- Red Cross Standard First Aid & CPR/AED Level C Certification (2017)
